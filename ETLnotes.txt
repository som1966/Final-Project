final project notes on ETL of the provided Dataset:

my task: clean , transform and merge the tables 1 -7; and put (table 3) as an index

My procedure: 
1) deleted the columns “series”, “footnotes” and “source” from the Dataframes 4 to 7 

3) renamed [“Value”] for each respective tables according to its original table. 

4) then combined tables 4 to 7 

5) noticed the null or NaN values for the clustered table4to7

6) cleaned that null-values-rows from the clustered table

7) dropped duplicate columns from the clusteredtables4to7_df

8) ordered the columns of the clustered table

9) checked any unique values, especially for column "year"
please note: per capita GDP's and pop density's year is not matching. one is 2019 and the other one is 2020!!!



------ exported the cleaned clustered table to the folder. -------------
